To date, no research and investigations were made to combine liquid fuel sloshing with free-floating robot dynamics. Thus, typical robotic motions for such a mission were analyzed and simulated first as rigid body motions. The satellite motion which results from the reaction to the robotic dynamic coupling was used as input for a dedicated computational fluid dynamics analysis (CFD). For slow motions, the results show relevant influence to the free-floating robot dynamics. However high dynamic motions, as they are needed for example for on-orbit dynamic identification, show a significant influence. Free-floating robot simulations with worst case configurations obtained from the CFD analysis showed a significant influence on the performance. Additionally a pendulum and a spring-mass model as equivalent mechanical model (EMM) were used for comparison with the CFD results. A nonlinear parameter identification was carried out to match the EMM models to obtain the same sloshing characteristics as the CFD results.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396687","","Robots;Liquids;Fuels;Dynamics;Satellites;Numerical models;Gravity","","2","","18","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, leading research in this topic has focused on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to devise methods of predictively controlling the location of fuel within a spacecraft's tank. In this paper, a Radio Frequency (RF)-based mechanism to measure the location and quantity of fuel in spacecraft tanks is presented. By treating the tank as a resonating cavity, movement of the fuel inside produces a shift in resonant frequency and a change in the quality factor for the different cavity resonating modes. This results from the differing dielectric properties for the volume of air, gas, or vacuum, compared to the volume of liquid propellant. It is shown that as a sphere of distilled water is moved linearly across the resonating cavity, and the S-parameters response of the cavity is strongly correlated with the position of the sphere. Exploiting this can attain the capability to measure both location and quantity of propellant contained within a tank in microgravity environments in real time while in flight.","2164-2974","978-1-7281-8062-5","10.1109/RWS50353.2021.9360361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360361","fuel sloshing;microgravity;propellant;resonant cavity;resonant modes;spacecraft;instrumentation;sensors","Space vehicles;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Computational fluid dynamics;Propulsion;Time measurement;Fuels","","","","7","IEEE","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can reduce the cost of space applications by extending the life span of large satellites like communication satellites, which have been used for critical missions. During the OOR mission, the liquid propellant like unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) is partially filled in a propellant tank, which can slosh and produce non-cooperative couple motion between the chaser-target satellite, which results in non-cooperative activity and leads to divergence in a coupled attitude of the satellite. A non-linear dynamic modeling of the liquid propellant mass transfer with sloshing was developed in this paper to simulate the on-orbit non-cooperative and inertial movement of the liquid propellant in the cylindrical propellant tank during refueling after proximity and docking of the chaser-target satellite, a fuel injector connected with the target satellite are modeled by using the time-varying spring mass damper system in the in-track motion of satellites, which is coequal to the motion of the propellant mass center, Whereas, time-varying pendulum model is used in the radial direction of the coupled satellite. During sloshing, a coequal propellant elliptical cylinder is developed to model the inertia of dispersed liquid propellants. Multiple scenarios of on-orbit propagation of coupled satellites are designed to provide the orbital disturbance to the propellant tank. In contrast, computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out to observe the liquid propellant dynamics behavior in micro-gravity in the propellant tanks and to verify the proposed non-linear dynamics model, as CFD simulation has no limitation on gravitational acceleration and can be applied to realistic flight sloshing tank models. A three-dimensional on-orbit sloshing behavior of the liquid propellant in micro-gravity is analyzed theoretically and numerically using the CFD. This paper provides the results of the propellant phase contour of the chaser and target spacecraft along the axial and radial direction throughout the refueling time. Various plots of propellant mass center (MC) and moment of inertia were sketched from the OpenFOAM CFD and compared with the results of a proposed coequal dynamic model. It was found that the suggested dynamic modeling accurately determines the sloshing behaviors along with the mass transfer motion during the onorbit refueling with fewer computation resources, and deviation in the sloshing parameters between the methods is less than ten percent.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521091","","Space vehicles;Satellites;Liquids;Computational modeling;Computational fluid dynamics;Propulsion;Aerodynamics","","","","39","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the main novelties consists of using pressure sensors inside the fuel tank to measure a quantity proportional to the sloshing torque.

This is achieved by two identification experiments. In Exp. 1, the SMS translates with locked joints allowing for the elimination of the unmeasurable sloshing states. As a result, all sloshing model parameters and the mass of the SMS base are identified.

The sloshing force is that the fluid, via pressure and viscous effects, exerts on the spacecraft, containing the sloshing disturbance and the inertial force of liquid. The modal decomposition technique is initially applied to the Burgers' equation to derive an infinite dimensional ODE system of coupled slow and fast dynamics, and thus, the sloshing disturbance is divided into two parts: slow and fast. Based on the slow subsystem of the Burgers' equation, an observer is constructed to estimate the slow sloshing disturbance, which is called the slow sloshing disturbance observer (SSDO). Then, a low dimensional SSDO-based H∞ SDRC design is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), where the slow sloshing disturbance is compensated by the SSDO, and the fast one is attenuated by H∞ control. The resulting controller can ensure that the ODE system of the spacecraft is exponentially stable in the presence of the slow sloshing disturbance and satisfies a prescribed attenuation level in the presence of the fast sloshing disturbance.

Many modern spacecraft and launch vehicles rely on large propellant tanks for attitude control and station-keeping maneuvers. When a sizable percentage of the space-craft’s mass comprises a liquid propellant, sloshing becomes a critical aspect of spacecraft control. SPICEsat aims to examine the zero-g propellant sloshing problem from an experimental standpoint. The primary mission will study tank fluid dynamics using new methods to understand low-gravity fluid disturbance effects better and improve equivalent mechanical models (EMMs). Active control of the fluid leading to the reduction of propellant slosh settling times will improve the performance of future spacecraft. SPICEsat’s secondary mission is to provide student education and outreach opportunities throughout the project lifecycle and release the data to the educational community for further research. In this paper, we will present SPICEsat project goals, educational benefits of the program, lessons learned, and areas of instructional improvement for undergraduate education.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521309","United States Air Force; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521309","","Space vehicles;Schedules;Software architecture;Space technology;Education;Buildings;Stars","","","","12","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For modelling the liquid fuel sloshing we combined the general free-floating robot dynamics with a mechanical pendulum equivalent model. For the dynamic parameter identification we extended our identification algorithm for rigid body systems to account for these two effects. The flexible and sloshing modes are excited only with the manipulator executing optimized trajectories. For the identification algorithm we make use of the robotic joint position and torque sensor data as well as of on board GNC sensor data. Numerical simulations showed that the two effects can have significant influence to the free-floating dynamics. Furthermore, we showed that the extended parameter identification algorithm improves the accuracy of the dynamic model.","","978-0-9567157-4-6","10.1109/ICMIC.2014.7020740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7020740","","Joints;Fuels;Manipulators;Satellites;Mathematical model;Robot sensing systems","","6","","14","","26 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was never attempted for small spacecraft, as critical technologies, such as six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) micropropulsion systems, have only recently become available due to advances in MEMS. The typical level of noise in nanosatellites' sensors and actuators combined with the dynamics uncertainties, low actuation capabilities, and reliability requirements makes the use of robust control appropriate. The system is described by a linearized rotation/translation, six DoFs, and coupled dynamics, including fuel sloshing. An ℌ∞ controller is first designed, in which robust stability and performance are assessed using structured singular values. The controller robustness is then improved using μ-synthesis. Nonlinear Monte Carlo simulations for both controllers, including realistic sensors and actuators models, are provided allowing a thorough assessment of the complete guidance, navigation and control (GNC). The sought GNC schemes are shown to be robust to the modeled uncertainties and to satisfy the docking requirements.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2019.2892923","European Space Agency(grant numbers:4000112462/14/NL/GLC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8635563","Cubesats;docking; ${\mathcal {H}_\infty }$  ;μ-analysis;μ-synthesis;rendezvous;robust control;satellites","CubeSat;Aerospace electronics;Europe;Uncertainty;Actuators","","12","","22","OAPA","5 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the classical case the spacecraft is assumed to consist of a single rigid body with three-axis torque inputs and with attitude and rate sensing. In practice, however, the situation may be far more complex. For example, any component of the spacecraft that deforms relative to other components will entail a change in the spacecraft mass distribution; in effect, the spacecraft becomes a multibody system. Similarly, structural flexibility and fuel slosh give rise to vibrational degrees of freedom. Spacecraft control is also exacerbated by sensor and actuator nonlinearities. Traditional actuation devices such as thrusters, reaction wheels, momentum wheels, and control moment gyros entail amplitude and rate saturation constraints, gyroscopic coupling, and coupling between translational and attitude dynamics. Additional difficulties arise when accounting for gravitational effects and external disturbances. All of these issues have technological implications. A fundamental difficulty associated with spacecraft technology is the fact that ground-based testing must occur in a 1-g environment whereas the hardware will operate under zero-g conditions. Consequently, spacecraft control engineering must depend on first-principles analysis as well as extrapolation from 1-g testing. The purpose of this paper is to describe a laboratory-based testbed that will be used to explore various issues and concepts in spacecraft dynamics and control. This testbed is based on a triaxial air bearing to allow experiments involving large-angle, three-axis motion. As a precursor to this testbed, we have also developed an air spindle testbed which allows single-axis rotation.","0743-1619","0-7803-6495-3","10.1109/ACC.2001.946287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946287","","Testing;Space vehicles;Space technology;Wheels;Torque;Fuels;Control nonlinearities;Actuators;Attitude control;Hardware","","29","","15","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
