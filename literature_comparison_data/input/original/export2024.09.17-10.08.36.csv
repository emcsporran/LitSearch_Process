To date, no research and investigations were made to combine liquid fuel sloshing with free-floating robot dynamics. Thus, typical robotic motions for such a mission were analyzed and simulated first as rigid body motions. The satellite motion which results from the reaction to the robotic dynamic coupling was used as input for a dedicated computational fluid dynamics analysis (CFD). For slow motions, the results show relevant influence to the free-floating robot dynamics. However high dynamic motions, as they are needed for example for on-orbit dynamic identification, show a significant influence. Free-floating robot simulations with worst case configurations obtained from the CFD analysis showed a significant influence on the performance. Additionally a pendulum and a spring-mass model as equivalent mechanical model (EMM) were used for comparison with the CFD results. A nonlinear parameter identification was carried out to match the EMM models to obtain the same sloshing characteristics as the CFD results.","","978-1-5386-2014-4","10.1109/AERO.2018.8396687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396687","","Robots;Liquids;Fuels;Dynamics;Satellites;Numerical models;Gravity","","2","","18","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, leading research in this topic has focused on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to devise methods of predictively controlling the location of fuel within a spacecraft's tank. In this paper, a Radio Frequency (RF)-based mechanism to measure the location and quantity of fuel in spacecraft tanks is presented. By treating the tank as a resonating cavity, movement of the fuel inside produces a shift in resonant frequency and a change in the quality factor for the different cavity resonating modes. This results from the differing dielectric properties for the volume of air, gas, or vacuum, compared to the volume of liquid propellant. It is shown that as a sphere of distilled water is moved linearly across the resonating cavity, and the S-parameters response of the cavity is strongly correlated with the position of the sphere. Exploiting this can attain the capability to measure both location and quantity of propellant contained within a tank in microgravity environments in real time while in flight.","2164-2974","978-1-7281-8062-5","10.1109/RWS50353.2021.9360361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360361","fuel sloshing;microgravity;propellant;resonant cavity;resonant modes;spacecraft;instrumentation;sensors","Space vehicles;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Computational fluid dynamics;Propulsion;Time measurement;Fuels","","","","7","IEEE","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can reduce the cost of space applications by extending the life span of large satellites like communication satellites, which have been used for critical missions. During the OOR mission, the liquid propellant like unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) is partially filled in a propellant tank, which can slosh and produce non-cooperative couple motion between the chaser-target satellite, which results in non-cooperative activity and leads to divergence in a coupled attitude of the satellite. A non-linear dynamic modeling of the liquid propellant mass transfer with sloshing was developed in this paper to simulate the on-orbit non-cooperative and inertial movement of the liquid propellant in the cylindrical propellant tank during refueling after proximity and docking of the chaser-target satellite, a fuel injector connected with the target satellite are modeled by using the time-varying spring mass damper system in the in-track motion of satellites, which is coequal to the motion of the propellant mass center, Whereas, time-varying pendulum model is used in the radial direction of the coupled satellite. During sloshing, a coequal propellant elliptical cylinder is developed to model the inertia of dispersed liquid propellants. Multiple scenarios of on-orbit propagation of coupled satellites are designed to provide the orbital disturbance to the propellant tank. In contrast, computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out to observe the liquid propellant dynamics behavior in micro-gravity in the propellant tanks and to verify the proposed non-linear dynamics model, as CFD simulation has no limitation on gravitational acceleration and can be applied to realistic flight sloshing tank models. A three-dimensional on-orbit sloshing behavior of the liquid propellant in micro-gravity is analyzed theoretically and numerically using the CFD. This paper provides the results of the propellant phase contour of the chaser and target spacecraft along the axial and radial direction throughout the refueling time. Various plots of propellant mass center (MC) and moment of inertia were sketched from the OpenFOAM CFD and compared with the results of a proposed coequal dynamic model. It was found that the suggested dynamic modeling accurately determines the sloshing behaviors along with the mass transfer motion during the onorbit refueling with fewer computation resources, and deviation in the sloshing parameters between the methods is less than ten percent.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521091","","Space vehicles;Satellites;Liquids;Computational modeling;Computational fluid dynamics;Propulsion;Aerodynamics","","","","39","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the main novelties consists of using pressure sensors inside the fuel tank to measure a quantity proportional to the sloshing torque.

Gravity tractors were devised to take advantage of the mutual gravitational force between a spacecraft flying in formation with the target celestial body to slowly alter the celestial body's trajectory. No physical contact is necessary, which bypasses issues associated with surface contact such as landing, anchoring, or spin compensation. The gravity tractor maneuver can take several forms, from the originally proposed constant thrust in-line hover to the offset halo orbit. Both can be enhanced with the collection of mass at the asteroid. The form of the gravity tractor ultimately impacts the required thrust magnitude to maintain the formation, as well as constraints on the vectoring of the thrust direction. Solar electric propulsion systems provide an efficient mechanism for tugging the spacecraft-asteroid system due to their high specific impulse. Electric propulsion systems can generate thrust continuously at high efficiency, which is an ideal property for gravity tractors that may require years of operation to achieve the desired deflection because of the very low coupling force provided by the gravitational attraction. The performance and feasibility of the deflection are predicated on having the propulsion capability to maintain the gravity tractor. This paper describes the impacts of constraining the solar electric propulsion thrust magnitude and thrust vectoring capability. It is shown that uncertainty in asteroid density and size, when combined with the enforcement of the electric propulsion constraints, can preclude the feasibility of certain gravity tractor configurations. Additionally, odd thruster configurations are shown to drive the gimbal performance and to have major impacts on eroding incident spacecraft surfaces due to plume interaction. Center of gravity movement further exacerbates issues with gimbaling and plume interaction. A tighter plume divergence angle is therefore always desired, but this paper shows that there is an optimal momentum balance between plume interaction and asteroid-plume avoidance. Several gravity tractor techniques are compared based on metrics of time efficacy, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit time, and mass efficiency, as measured by the induced asteroid delta-V per unit mass of fuel. Given the propulsion constraints, halo orbits can be infeasible for smaller asteroids unless the mass of the spacecraft is augmented with collected material through a technique called the Enhanced Gravity Tractor. Another proposed method is to alter the halo period by canting the thrusters. In-line hover gravity tractors can always be moved along the net thrust direction to conform to the given propulsion system at the expense of performance, except in the case of smaller asteroids with propulsion systems that are limited in lower throttle range or maximum gimbal angle. Alternative strategies, such as on-off pulsing the thrusters to lower the effective thrust are considered. An example is described for deflecting asteroid 2008 EV5 (341843), which currently serves as the reference asteroid for the proposed Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission.","","978-1-5090-1613-6","10.1109/AERO.2017.7943774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943774","","Gravity;Agricultural machinery;Propulsion;Space vehicles;Orbits;Uncertainty","","","","11","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The high power, heat flux, and volumetric heat generation of emerging devices are driving the transition from remote cooling, which relies on conduction and spreading, to embedded cooling, which facilitates direct contact between the heat-generating device and coolant flow. Microgap coolers employ the forced flow of dielectric fluids undergoing phase change in a heated channel between devices. While two-phase microcoolers are used routinely in ground-based systems, the lack of acceptable models and correlations for microgravity operation has limited their use for spacecraft thermal management. Previous research has revealed that gravitational acceleration plays a diminishing role as the channel diameter shrinks, but there is considerable variation among the proposed gravity-insensitive channel dimensions and minimal research on rectangular ducts. Reliable criteria for achieving gravity-insensitive flow boiling performance would enable spaceflight systems to exploit this powerful thermal management technique and reduce development time and costs through reliance on ground-based testing. In the present effort, the authors have studied the effect of evaporator orientation on flow boiling performance of HFE7100 in a 218 μm tall by 13.0 mm wide microgap cooler. Similar heat transfer coefficients and critical heat flux were achieved across five evaporator orientations, indicating that the effect of gravity was negligible.","","978-1-5090-2994-5","10.1109/ITHERM.2017.7992513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7992513","","Gravity;Heat transfer;Liquids;Hydraulic diameter;Electron tubes;Heating systems","","5","","36","IEEE","27 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The maximum liquid transport rates through different micropillar wick geometries operating against gravity are determined at various wicking lengths by measuring the dryout threshold. The capillary pressure and the permeability of these wicks are obtained by fitting the mass flow rate vs. wicking length data to Darcy's law. The permeability and capillary pressure values of these geometries are subsequently used to validate literature models of these two parameters. A permeability model, based on Stokes flow past infinitely long cylinders and corrected to account for the effect of meniscus curvature and finite pillar height, closely predicts the experimental data. A capillary model relating the pressure to the wick geometry using a thermodynamic approach better predicts the experimental results. An overall model consisting of Darcy's law and the selected capillary and permeability models, and capable of predicting mass flow rates through these arrays is proposed. Genetic algorithms together with the overall mass flow rate model are used to design optimized micropillar wicks. It is shown that the dimensions of the optimum geometry vary with the wicking length for devices operating against gravity. Experimental data from a representative optimal wick are used to verify the theoretical optimization results.

Nevertheless, even simple phenomena such as the pinching together of two plates require delicate instruments for observation. Our group proposed a simple experimental setup in which parallel plates separated by small gaps and fixed at their bottom ends were lowered into a liquid. Bending deformation of the plates caused by capillary rises between their inner surfaces was observed at the liquid surface. The experiments revealed that plates do not coalesce simultaneously, but in a sequence starting from pairs with the current smallest gap and with little influence of capillary rises in neighboring plates. After each pair of plates had coalesced, they behave as a single plate causing subsequent coalescences to occur in a similar manner. An analytical model based on this prescription is established to predict the deflection of plate pairs up until coalescence finishes. The effectiveness of the model was confirmed by accurately predicting the sequence of coalescence in multiple plates. Furthermore, it is presented that conditions required to avoid either coalescence in a pair of plates or complete coalescence of all plates can be determined by a non-dimensional parameter.","1941-0158","","10.1109/JMEMS.2019.2913012","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:JP15K17934); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710630","Analytical models;electronics packaging;etching;microfabrication;microfluidics;surface tension","Liquids;Strain;Microelectromechanical systems;Analytical models;Oils;Self-assembly;Manufacturing","","2","","30","IEEE","9 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the classical case the spacecraft is assumed to consist of a single rigid body with three-axis torque inputs and with attitude and rate sensing. In practice, however, the situation may be far more complex. For example, any component of the spacecraft that deforms relative to other components will entail a change in the spacecraft mass distribution; in effect, the spacecraft becomes a multibody system. Similarly, structural flexibility and fuel slosh give rise to vibrational degrees of freedom. Spacecraft control is also exacerbated by sensor and actuator nonlinearities. Traditional actuation devices such as thrusters, reaction wheels, momentum wheels, and control moment gyros entail amplitude and rate saturation constraints, gyroscopic coupling, and coupling between translational and attitude dynamics. Additional difficulties arise when accounting for gravitational effects and external disturbances. All of these issues have technological implications. A fundamental difficulty associated with spacecraft technology is the fact that ground-based testing must occur in a 1-g environment whereas the hardware will operate under zero-g conditions. Consequently, spacecraft control engineering must depend on first-principles analysis as well as extrapolation from 1-g testing. The purpose of this paper is to describe a laboratory-based testbed that will be used to explore various issues and concepts in spacecraft dynamics and control. This testbed is based on a triaxial air bearing to allow experiments involving large-angle, three-axis motion. As a precursor to this testbed, we have also developed an air spindle testbed which allows single-axis rotation.","0743-1619","0-7803-6495-3","10.1109/ACC.2001.946287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=946287","","Testing;Space vehicles;Space technology;Wheels;Torque;Fuels;Control nonlinearities;Actuators;Attitude control;Hardware","","29","","15","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A hopper is a vehicle that has both landing and surface mobility capabilities on a single platform. Unlike rovers, which traverse the lunar surface while in contact with the ground, hopping reuses the landing propulsion system to lift back off again and ¿hop¿ over the lunar terrain. Hopping, as a form of surface mobility, is a novel concept. As such, analysis must be performed to assess how it would fit with an overall lunar landing system architecture. Two trajectory categories are investigated to perform this assessment: the ballistic hop, where the vehicle launches itself into a ballistic trajectory toward the destination, and the hover hop, in which the vehicle ascends and maintains a constant altitude as it travels toward its desired location. Initially, parametric studies of the ballistic and hover hop are carried out in order to make observations about the performance of each hop. Using this data, it is possible to investigate the fuel-optimal hop trajectory. The delta-V costs for the ballistic and hover hops are compared for hop distances between 500 meters and 5000 meters, and in this range it is found that the ballistic hop and hover traverse have comparable delta-V costs. For the entire hop maneuver, however, the hover hop will always be the more delta-V expensive option due to the ascent and descent phases. Nevertheless, this does not rule out the hover hop as a feasible option due to its operational advantages over the ballistic hop.","1095-323X","978-1-4244-3887-7","10.1109/AERO.2010.5446728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5446728","","Moon;Performance analysis;Vehicles;Surface fitting;Engines;Propulsion;Costs;Laboratories;Parametric study;Biographies","","9","","2","IEEE","15 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
